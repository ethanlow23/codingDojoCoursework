1.Create a database called 'my_first_db'.
	use my_first_db
2.Create students collection.
	db.createCollection('students')
3.Each document you insert into this collection should have the following format: ({name: STRING, home_state: STRING, lucky_number: NUMBER, birthday: {month: NUMBER, day: NUMBER, year: NUMBER}})
4.Create 5 students with the appropriate info.
	db.students.insert({name: 'student1', home_state: 'state1', lucky_number: 7, birthday: {month: 12, day: 31, year: 1950}})
	db.students.insert({name: 'student2', home_state: 'state2', lucky_number: 7, birthday: {month: 12, day: 31, year: 1950}})
	db.students.insert({name: 'student3', home_state: 'state3', lucky_number: 7, birthday: {month: 12, day: 31, year: 1950}})
	db.students.insert({name: 'student4', home_state: 'state4', lucky_number: 7, birthday: {month: 12, day: 31, year: 1950}})
	db.students.insert({name: 'student5', home_state: 'state5', lucky_number: 7, birthday: {month: 12, day: 31, year: 1950}})
5.Get all students.
	db.students.find({})
6.Retrieve all students who are from California (San Jose Dojo) or Washington (Seattle Dojo).
	db.students.find({$or: [{home_state: 'California'}, {home_state: 'Washington'}]})
7.Get all students whose lucky number is:
	7.1-greater than 3
		db.students.find({lucky_number: {$gt: 3}})
	7.2-less than or equal to 10
		db.students.find({lucky_number: {$lte: 10}})
	7.3-between 1 and 9 (inclusive)
		db.students.find({$and: [{lucky_number: {$gte: 1}, lucky_number: {$lte: 9}}]})
8.Add a field to each student collection called 'interests' that is an ARRAY.  It should contain the following entries: 'coding', 'brunch', 'MongoDB'. Do this in ONE operation.
	db.students.update({}, {$set: {interests: ['coding', 'brunch', 'MongoDB']}}, {multi: true})
9.Add some unique interests for each particular student into each of their interest arrays.
	db.students.update({name: 'student3'}, {$push: {interests: 'vodka'}})
10.Add the interest 'taxes' into someone's interest array.
	db.students.update({name: 'student1'}, {$push: {interests: 'taxes'}})
11.Remove the 'taxes' interest you just added.
	db.students.update({name: 'student1'}, {$pop: {interests: 1}})
12.Remove all students who are from California (or Washington).
	db.students.remove({$or: [{home_state: 'California'}, {home_state: 'Washington'}]})
13.Remove a student by name.
	db.students.remove({name: 'student5'})
14.Remove a student whose lucky number is greater than 5 (JUST ONE)
	db.students.remove({lucky_number: {$gt: 5}}, true)
15.Add a field to each student collection called 'number_of_belts' and set it to 0.
	db.students.update({}, {$set: {number_of_belts: 0}})
16.Increment this field by 1 for all students in Washington (Seattle Dojo).

17.Rename the 'number_of_belts' field to 'belts_earned'

18.Remove the 'lucky_number' field.

19.( Add a 'updated_on' field, and set the value as the current date. )
